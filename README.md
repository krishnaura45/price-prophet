### INTRODUCTION
- Accurate house price prediction is vital for real estate valuation, investment, and decision-making.
- Traditional ML workflows often suffer from:
  - Poor reproducibility and pipeline modularity
  - Lack of production-readiness and deployment integration
  - Minimal tracking or model lifecycle management
- Price Prophet addresses this by building a clean, reproducible, and production-ready ML pipeline from ingestion to deployment.
- Built with Python, ZenML, MLflow, and Streamlit, it ensures seamless orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and user-friendly inference.
