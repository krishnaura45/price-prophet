### INTRODUCTION
- Accurate house price prediction is vital for real estate valuation, investment, and decision-making.
- Traditional ML workflows often suffer from:
  - Poor reproducibility and pipeline modularity
  - Lack of production-readiness and deployment integration
  - Minimal tracking or model lifecycle management
- Price Prophet addresses this by building a clean, reproducible, and production-ready ML pipeline from ingestion to deployment.
- Built with Python, ZenML, MLflow, and Streamlit, it ensures seamless orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and user-friendly inference.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
- **Manual Workflows**: Traditional house price prediction lacks automation, requiring repetitive preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Pipeline Gaps**: Most ML solutions stop at model accuracy, missing crucial components like deployment, tracking, and maintainability.
- **Lack of Production Readiness**: Existing approaches don't support reproducible, scalable, or monitorable model deployment in real-world settings.
- **End-to-End MLOps**: There is a clear need for a robust, automated pipeline integrating data handling, modeling, versioning, and serving with real-time inference.

---

### OBJECTIVES
- **Ultimate Aim**: Build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline.
- Perform robust data processing and heavy feature engineering so as to get best model performance.
- Utilize and compare multiple regression strategies for price prediction.
- Integrate MLOps tools like ZenML and Mlflow.
- Build a front-end application for user interaction and visualization.
- Eensure production readiness by focusing on modularity, reproducibility, version control, and real-time prediction capability.
