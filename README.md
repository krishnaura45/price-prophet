### INTRODUCTION

<img align="right" width="320" height="300" alt="house-image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5708a76c-8e57-48c7-8d7b-8284ddf3b209" />

- Accurate house price prediction is vital for real estate valuation, investment, and decision-making.
- Traditional ML workflows often suffer from:
  - Poor reproducibility and pipeline modularity
  - Lack of production-readiness and deployment integration
  - Minimal tracking or model lifecycle management
- Price Prophet addresses this by building a clean, reproducible, and production-ready ML pipeline from ingestion to deployment.
- Built with Python, ZenML, MLflow, and Streamlit, it ensures seamless orchestration, experiment tracking, deployment, and user-friendly inference.

### PROBLEM DEFINITION
- **Manual Workflows**: Traditional house price prediction lacks automation, requiring repetitive preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Pipeline Gaps**: Most ML solutions stop at model accuracy, missing crucial components like deployment, tracking, and maintainability.
- **Lack of Production Readiness**: Existing approaches don't support reproducible, scalable, or monitorable model deployment in real-world settings.
- **End-to-End MLOps**: There is a clear need for a robust, automated pipeline integrating data handling, modeling, versioning, and serving with real-time inference.

---

### OBJECTIVES üß∞
- **Ultimate Aim**: Build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline.
- Perform robust data processing and heavy feature engineering so as to get best model performance.
- Utilize and compare multiple regression strategies for price prediction.
- Integrate MLOps tools like ZenML and Mlflow.
- Build a front-end application for user interaction and visualization.
- Eensure production readiness by focusing on modularity, reproducibility, version control, and real-time prediction capability.

### METHODOLOGY üîß
#### Pipeline Workflow
<img width="1538" height="692" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e4fbe08-842c-4081-937a-c92cad53733f" />

#### Core ML Stages
| Stage                     | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Ingestion**        | Loads and extracts raw housing data from compressed archives (`archive.zip`).                                |
| **Initial Preprocessing** | Cleans missing values and duplicates; prepares dataset for transformation.                                   |
| **Feature Engineering**   | Applies log-transformations and constructs domain-inspired features like `Porch`, `Bath_total`, and `FinSF`. |
| **Outlier Handling**      | Identifies and removes extreme values from critical features such as `SalePrice`.                            |
| **Data Splitting**        | Splits data into train/test using stratified sampling while preserving target distribution.                  |
| **Model Building**        | Trains a stacked ensemble using base models (XGBoost, LightGBM) with meta-model (Linear Regression).         |
| **Model Evaluation**            | Computes RMSE, MSE, and R¬≤ metrics using MLflow logging and visualization.                                   |
| **Deployment Preparation**       | Logs the model artifacts and expected columns to MLflow for reproducible serving.                            |

#### Model Deployment
- Deployment via MLflow Model Deployer Service (Not suitable for Windows OS) <br> <img width="307" height="111" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d7e8fc6-e88a-4203-a9ed-116208bddc96" />

- Manual MLflow Model Serving via REST API (Works for MAC/Windows OS) <br> <img width="408" height="121" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/514fefad-9a26-477d-8924-c0612f2fcb4c" />

#### Inference
- **Batch Inference (Local REST API)**:
  - Once the model is served manually using MLflow, predictions can be made by sending input data (as JSON) via HTTP POST to the /invocations endpoint.
  - A sample_batch_predict.py script is used to load a .csv file, send data to the model server, and save predictions in predictions.csv.

- **Real-Time Inference (Streamlit Application)**:
  - A user-friendly UI built with Streamlit allows manual input or CSV uploads.
  - Sends the data to the same REST endpoint and displays predicted house prices instantly.
  - Supports downloading predictions and visualization inside the web app.
